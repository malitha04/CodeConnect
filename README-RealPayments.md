| **PayPal** | 🔄 Simulated | Ready for PayPal SDK integration |
| **Bank Transfer** | 🔄 Manual | Instructions provided |
| **Cryptocurrency** | 🔄 Manual | Wallet addresses provided |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Stripe Account Setup
1. Create a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Complete account verification
3. Get your API keys from the Dashboard

### 2. Environment Configuration
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
STRIPE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

### 3. Webhook Setup (Recommended)
1. In Stripe Dashboard: **Developers** → **Webhooks**
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/payments/stripe/webhook`
3. Select events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
```sql
payments table:
- id (Primary Key)
- project_id (Foreign Key)
- client_id (Foreign Key)
- developer_id (Foreign Key)
- amount (Decimal)
- payment_method (Enum)
- transaction_id (String)
- status (Enum)
- payment_details (JSON)
- paid_at (Timestamp)
```

### Key Files
- `app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php` - Main payment logic
- `app/Models/Payment.php` - Payment model with relationships
- `resources/views/payments/stripe-checkout.blade.php` - Stripe checkout form
- `config/services.php` - Stripe configuration
- `routes/web.php` - Payment routes

### Payment Flow
1. **Client initiates payment** → Payment record created
2. **Stripe PaymentIntent created** → Redirected to checkout
3. **Client enters card details** → Stripe processes payment
4. **Webhook receives result** → Payment status updated
5. **Success/Failure handled** → User redirected with status

## 🧪 Testing

### Stripe Test Cards
- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **Requires Auth**: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

### Test Scenarios
1. **Successful Payment**: Use test card, verify status updates
2. **Failed Payment**: Use decline card, check error handling
3. **Webhook Testing**: Use Stripe CLI for local testing

## 🔒 Security Features

### Payment Security
- **PCI Compliance**: Stripe handles sensitive card data
- **Webhook Verification**: Signed webhook validation
- **Authorization Checks**: Only authorized users can make payments
- **Transaction Tracking**: Complete audit trail

### Data Protection
- No card data stored locally
- Encrypted payment details
- Secure API communication
- Role-based access control

## 📊 Payment Status Tracking

### Status Flow
```
pending → processing → completed/failed
```

### Status Meanings
- **Pending**: Payment initiated, awaiting processing
- **Processing**: Payment being processed by gateway
- **Completed**: Payment successful, funds transferred
- **Failed**: Payment failed, no funds transferred
- **Refunded**: Payment was refunded

## 🎨 User Experience

1. **Project Completion** → "Make Payment" button appears
2. **Payment Method Selection** → Choose Stripe, PayPal, etc.
3. **Secure Checkout** → Stripe-hosted payment form
4. **Confirmation** → Payment status and receipt

### Developer Experience
1. **Payment Notifications** → Real-time status updates
2. **Earnings Tracking** → Total earnings calculation
3. **Payment History** → Complete payment records
4. **Manual Confirmation** → Mark manual payments as received

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

### PayPal Integration
```php
// TODO: Implement PayPal SDK
composer require paypal/rest-api-sdk-php
```

### Additional Features
- **Escrow System**: Hold payments until project completion
- **Split Payments**: Multiple payment installments
- **Currency Support**: Multi-currency payments
- **Payment Analytics**: Detailed payment reporting
- **Automated Invoicing**: Generate invoices automatically

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
